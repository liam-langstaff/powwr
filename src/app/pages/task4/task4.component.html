    <h1>Tasks 3 & 4: Reflective Notes</h1>

    <h2>Key Observations</h2>
    <p>
      Working solely from a static screenshot introduces significant challenges, particularly a lack of context and consistency.
      Without access to a design tool or additional specifications, assumptions had to be made regarding essential aspects such
      as font sizes, colors, spacing, and overall layout. Moving forward, having at least a design tool or detailed guidelines
      is critical to mitigate these issues. This ensures alignment and helps avoid inconsistencies or misinterpretations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another potential issue or question is the material focus / ripple. Many of these native material components especially buttons
      have their own ripple. To make this work and look how they want, they all need appropriate padding. This was the case for the
      pagination back and forward buttons. I decided to keep this effect in however may seem slightly off from the design. Without
      discussing with the designer it is unclear if this should be intentional or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, well-defined requirements for any new feature are essential. These not only promote consistency but also
      prevent scope creep or over-engineering, which can arise from vague or incomplete specifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    <p>There are a few design elements I would highlight for review had I been involved in the design phase. For instance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dropdown Menu Padding:</strong> The provided screenshot suggests an imbalance between the left and right
        padding of the dropdown menu items, possibly due to the combination of left alignment and a <code>flex: 1</code>
        property filling available space. This imbalance could create visual inconsistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Search Bar Absence:</strong> If the interface involves hundreds of deals or entries, the lack of a search
        bar could create friction for users, forcing them to spend unnecessary time navigating the interface to find
        specific details.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Implementation Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tender Steps:</strong> The tender steps use the <code>mat-card</code> component in combination with button
        elements to ensure default behaviors such as pointer cursor changes and keyboard accessibility (e.g., tab navigation).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UUID for Mocking:</strong> When navigating to a new tender, I generated a random UUID and stored it in
        local storage. This simulates a backend flow by enabling users to revisit the same URL and retrieve the mock data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency in Titles:</strong> Minor inconsistencies in the tender step titles were addressed.
        Specifically, the usage of "&" and "and" was standardized to "&" throughout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component States:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Status Tags:</strong> In the design, all status tags were marked as "Pending." I considered it vital
            to represent other potential states to ensure spacing and alignment remained consistent across the container
            or feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Table Cell Overflow:</strong> Designs often show ideal scenarios, such as short text in table cells.
            In practice, longer text may overflow into adjacent cells. To address this, an ellipsis for
            text that exceeds the available space should be included.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Skeleton Loader:</strong> Instead of a spinner replacing the entire table, I opted for a skeleton loader
        to enhance the user experience. This design decision provides a clearer visual cue that data is being retrieved
        while maintaining the structure of the interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>API Mocks:</strong> In reflection, to simulate a response further, I could of container the steps content within the localStorage object and retrieve it from there. This would allow for a more realistic experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
